My name is Sophie Lancaster and I am originally from Warsaw, Indiana. I am a senior at the University of Notre Dame studying Computer Science with a minor in Engineering Corporate Practice. I have spent a summer researching machine learning in Budapest, Hungary and a summer in Ashburn, Virginia working for Verizon as a data analytics intern.
